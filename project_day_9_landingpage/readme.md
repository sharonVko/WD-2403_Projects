Welcome to Shapely Demo! üéâ This is my first solo project where I bring a Figma design to life using HTML and CSS. The highlight of this project is the stunning parallax effect that adds depth and dynamism to the web page.


**Introduction**

Shapely Demo is a web page project that showcases a beautiful parallax effect, inspired by a design created in Figma. This project is a testament to my journey in web development, combining creativity with technical skills.

**Features**
- Parallax Scrolling: Experience a captivating 3D depth effect as you scroll through the page.
- Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on all devices.
- Clean and Modern UI: A sleek design that is both visually appealing and user-friendly.
